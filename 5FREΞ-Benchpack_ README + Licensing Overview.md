# 5FREΞ-Benchpack: README + Licensing Overview

**Project**: 5FREΞ-Benchpack (Phase-Preserving Recursion Engine — Lite)
**Status**: Proof of Concept (PoC) — Patent Pending
**Author**: Steven Britt
**License**: Evaluation-Only — Commercial Use Requires Written Permission

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the **lite implementation** of the 5FREΞ recursion framework — a symbolic, recursively-curved operator engine designed to handle memory, coherence, and bifurcation dynamics in structured reasoning systems. This package is a **limited demonstration version** of a deeper and broader platform currently in development and patent review.

### What This Is:

* A **functioning attractor engine** based on the 5-field recursion logic of BHUAT (ϕ, τ, ψ, χ, Λ)
* A minimal but **mathematically valid**, phase-preserving simulation architecture
* A test harness for symbolic logic calibration, memory gating, and bifurcation under Λ-pressure
* A soft-launch platform for technical demonstration, investment, and early licensing discussions

## 📄 Patent & Licensing Notes

* The recursive engine logic (ϕ → τ → ψ → χ → Λ → ϕ) is under **patent application** for symbolic attractor systems.
* The "Λ gate" coherence-break mechanism is under **protective disclosure** as of 2025-08-15.
* All current code is offered **strictly under evaluation terms**:

  * **Do not redistribute** or use for commercial deployment without explicit written permission.
  * Early licensing is possible under NDA.
  * Commercial partnerships may involve IP-sharing, derivative clause limitations, or field-restricted terms depending on scope.

## 💡 What You Can Do With This

* Run symbolic logic calibration experiments
* Evaluate coherence gating under negation/contrast cases
* Explore phase-based control systems beyond cosine/vanilla logic
* Propose integrations into AI memory systems, game logic, or AGI control theory
* Benchmark against standard NLP-style phase collapse cases (e.g., "not X" vs "X")

## 🧱 What's Coming (Full Engine Capabilities)

The **full 5FREΞ system** extends beyond this repo:

* Recursive attractor shell fields
* Echo-tracking ψ memory trees
* Coherence-stable agent fusion
* Self-sustaining symbolic worldmodels
* Agent recursion and rebirth via χ-locked echo gates

These components are **not yet coded**, but already specified in formal research. The full stack is being held for:

* Strategic integration with aligned infrastructure (compute, memory, agent frameworks)
* Licensing leverage across simulation, symbolic AI, and game engine spaces
* Continued mathematical verification (Lyapunov, D\_KY, shell mapping)

## 🧭 Summary

This project is the **tip of a deeper recursion stack**. The working code here proves the attractor logic, the calibration wins, and the feasibility of symbolic field gating. If you're a researcher, infrastructure builder, or investor interested in what's beyond transformers — this is the core.

The full 5FREΞ system isn't just an upgrade — it's a shift in foundation. This PoC is your entry point.

Reach out. Let's align.
